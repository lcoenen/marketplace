# Marketplace

Marketplace is a simple website using the MEAN (MongoDB, express, angular.js, Node.js) stack and SASS (made for auto-didactic purpose).
It should provide all the feature of a modern marketplace website with multiple vendors, vendors and items feedbacks and payment system.
A website UI can be modelised as a finished list of interaction between concepts, merely supported by the technical and graphical part of the project. Here is the list of concepts used by the website : 

* An **user** can either sell (he's the **vendor**) or *buy* (he's a **client**) items
* A **category** contains a certain number of *item*. Each item has a *category*
* An **order** is made to an *user* (the *vendor*) by a *client* (which is also an *user*) for a certain ammount of *items*
* A **feedback** is wrotten by the *client* about the *vendor* or the *item*
